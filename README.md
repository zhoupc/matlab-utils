# matlab-utils
a collection of MATLAB util functions. 

## why this package
All functions in this repo are used by multiple packages developed by me, but they are too small to be an independent package. So I put everything into one repo. Most functions were written by me, but some are downloaded from internet (see acknowledgement below).
